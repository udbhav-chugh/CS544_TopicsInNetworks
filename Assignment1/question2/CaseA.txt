Given:
For each queue, mean arrival rate is 100 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 1000 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1 queue systems

For Queue 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.0998756
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.00111136
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.000110564
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.0110338
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 0.110909

For Queue 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.100024
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.00111103
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.000110698
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.0110688
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 0.111093
