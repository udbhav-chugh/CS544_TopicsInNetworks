Given:
For each queue, mean arrival rate is 25 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 30 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1 queue systems

For Queue 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.831929
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.200874
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.167618
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 4.19318
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 5.02511

For Queue 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.831802
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.199131
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.165869
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 4.14789
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 4.97969
