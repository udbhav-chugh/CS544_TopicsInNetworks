Given:
For each queue, mean arrival rate is 1 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 2 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1 queue systems

For Queue 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.499959 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.999726 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.499906 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.500044 workers
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 1 workers

For Queue 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.500371 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 1.00034 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.50023 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.500492 workers
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 1.00086 workers
