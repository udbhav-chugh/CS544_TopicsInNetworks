Given:
For each queue, mean arrival rate is 1 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 4 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1 queue systems

For Queue 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.25019
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.332849
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.0828996
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.0829794
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 0.333169

For Queue 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.250133
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.332613
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.0828029
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.0829099
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 0.333043
