Given:
For each queue, mean arrival rate is 0.25 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 0.3 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1 queue systems

For Queue 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.832126
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 19.7434
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 16.4148
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 4.10355
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 4.93568

For Queue 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.833189
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 19.7428
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 16.4074
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 4.09862
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 4.9318
