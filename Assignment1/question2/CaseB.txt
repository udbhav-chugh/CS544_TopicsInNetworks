Given:
For the common queue, mean arrival rate is 25 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 15 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of M/M/2 queue system

a) Average number of workers getting checked: 1.66485
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.215306
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.148621
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 3.71045
Additionally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 5.37531
