Given:
For each counter, mean arrival rate is 0.25 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 0.413 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1/6 queue systems

For Counter 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.593076
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 5.36908
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 2.94876
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.722566
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 1.31564

For Counter 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.593044
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 5.38864
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 2.96571
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.725899
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 1.31894
