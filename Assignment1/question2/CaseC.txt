Given:
For each counter, mean arrival rate is 25 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 30 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1/6 queue systems

For Counter 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.76874
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.0991082
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.0658136
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 1.51957
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 2.28831
For Counter 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.767728
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.099289
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.0659369
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 1.51779
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 2.28552
