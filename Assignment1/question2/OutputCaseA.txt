Given:
For each queue, mean arrival rate is 2 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 4 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1 queue systems

For Queue 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.499153 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.497192 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.247315 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.494034 workers
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked or in queue): 0.993187 workers

For Queue 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.499825 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.499735 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.249639 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.498912 workers
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked or in queue): 0.998737 workers
