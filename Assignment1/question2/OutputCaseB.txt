Given:
For the common queue, mean arrival rate is 0.25 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 0.15 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of M/M/2 queue system

a) Average number of workers getting checked: 1.66948 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 21.9289 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 15.2617 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 3.82155 workers
Additionally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 5.49102
 workers
