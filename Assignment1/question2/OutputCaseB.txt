Given:
For the common queue, mean arrival rate is 1 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 2 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of M/M/2 queue system

a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.500256 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.533231 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.0335502 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.0335888 workers
Additionally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked or in queue): 0.533844
 workers
