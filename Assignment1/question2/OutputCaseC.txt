Given:
For each counter, mean arrival rate is 1 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 2 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1/6 queue systems

For Counter 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.496897 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.954264 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.453981 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.450909 workers
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked or in queue): 0.947806 workers

For Counter 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.496038 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 0.95038 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 0.450814 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.44763 workers
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked or in queue): 0.943668 workers
