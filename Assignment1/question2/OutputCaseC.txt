Given:
For each counter, mean arrival rate is 0.25 workers per second with exponential distribution
For each officer, mean service rate is 0.413059 workers per second with exponential distribution
This is a case of two M/M/1/6 queue systems

For Counter 1: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.593961 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 5.40249 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 2.97872 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.729955 workers
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 1.32392 workers

For Counter 2: 
a) Average number of workers getting checked: 0.593108 workers
b) Average response time for workers in getting checked: 5.40016 seconds
c) Average time for which a worker has to wait until getting checked: 2.97677 seconds
d) Average number of workers waiting in the queue before each officer: 0.728546 workers
Additonally, Average number of workers in the system (getting checked + in queue): 1.32165 workers
